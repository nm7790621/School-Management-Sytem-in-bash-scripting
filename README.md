# School-Management-Sytem-in-bash-scripting
🎓 This is a School Management System built using Bash scripting 🖥️. It's a simple command-line tool designed to help manage school data like student and teacher information. The system is easy to use and works right from the terminal, making it a great way to practice Linux and scripting skills.

📁 With this system, you can add, update, delete, search, and view records in a neat and organized way 📋. It uses basic Linux tools such as echo, read,etc and file handling commands to perform different actions. All the data is stored in plain text files, so you don't need any database setup.

🚀 This project is perfect for beginners who want to learn shell scripting and understand how to build real-world tools using simple code. It’s a fun and educational project to explore the power of Bash and automate everyday tasks in a school-like setup! 🏫
